This repository contains a personal portfolio project demonstrating data science and machine learning techniques in Python, presented as an interactive Jupyter Notebook.

## **Project Overview**
- Explores data-driven workflows including:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Applying machine learning models (PCA, clustering)
  - Evaluation and interpretation of model results
- Organized to showcase clean, reproducible, and well-documented code.

## **Technologies & Libraries**
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook

## **Purpose**
- Built as part of a personal portfolio to demonstrate:
  - Practical ML / data science skills
  - Ability to document and communicate technical work
  - End-to-end data project structure

## **Author**
Gabriel Ivan Ortega (Yiyo)
