# Learner Fullcode Notebook

This repository contains a personal portfolio project demonstrating data science and machine learning techniques in Python, presented as an interactive Jupyter Notebook (exported to HTML).

##**Project Overview**
- Explores data-driven workflows including:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Applying machine learning models (e.g., regression, clustering, or deep learning)
  - Evaluation and interpretation of model results
- Organized to showcase clean, reproducible, and well-documented code.

##**Technologies & Libraries**
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML export for easy viewing

##**Purpose**
- Built as part of a personal portfolio to demonstrate:
  - Practical ML / data science skills
  - Ability to document and communicate technical work
  - End-to-end data project structure

##**How to View**
